/**
 *  Base wrapper class around FreeRTOS's implementation of semaphores.
 *
 *  We do not want a Semaphore ctor. This class should never be directly
 *  created, this is a base class only.
 *
 *  It is not expected that an application will derive from this class.
 *
 *  Note that we distinguish between Semaphore, Binary Semaphores,
 *  Counting Semaphores, and Mutexes. Mutexes, while implemented as a kind
 *  of semaphore in FreeRTOS, are conceptually very different in use and
 *  behavior from semaphores. We acknowledge this difference in the class
 *  heirarchy, implementing mutextes as a completely different class heirarchy.
